# DIAMOND-PRICE-PREDICTION
# Diamond-price-prediction model
This is my first data science model made using python on jupyter notebooks

## Project Details
### Problem Statement
A diamond distributor has recently decided to exit the market and has put up a set of 3,000 diamonds up for auction. Seeing this as a great opportunity to expand its inventory, a jewelry company has shown interest in making a bid. To decide how much to bid, you will use a large database of diamond prices to build a model to predict the price of a diamond based on its attributes. Then you will use the results of that model to make a recommendation for how much the company should bid.

The diamond price that the model predicts represents the final retail price the consumer will pay. The company generally purchases diamonds from distributors at 70% of the that price, so your recommended bid price should represent that.

# Data Understanding

There are two datasets, diamonds.csv contains the data used to build the regression model. new_diamonds_new.csv contains the data for the diamonds the company would like to purchase. Both datasets contain carat, cut, and clarity data for each diamond. Only the diamonds.csv dataset has prices. You'll be predicting prices for the new_diamonds.csv dataset.

+ Carat represents the weight of the diamond, and is a numerical variable.
+ Cut represents the quality of the cut of the diamond, and falls into 5 categories: fair, good, very good, ideal, and premium. In project zero, these categories were represented by an ordinal variable, 1-5. You can decide to use the ordinal or categorical variable.
+ Clarity represents the internal purity of the diamond, and falls into 8 categories: I1, SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, and IF (in order from least to most pure). In project zero, these categories were represented by an ordinal variable, 1-8. You can decide to use the ordinal or categorical variable.
+ Color represents the color of the diamond, and is rated D through J, with D being the most colorless (and valuable) and J being the most yellow.

# Recommendation

Note: The diamond price that the model predicts represents the final retail price the consumer will pay. The company generally purchases diamonds from distributors at 70% of the that price, so your recommended bid price should represent that.

I would like as many critic as possible to learn since this is my first model. I know I might have made one or more mistakes here and there and thats why I need opinions, corrections, criticisms and commendations from anyone willing to look at my work.
